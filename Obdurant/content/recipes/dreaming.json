I listened to a hussar recall the Ottoman rout at Vienna; a rifleman of the White Guard mused about shooting bolsheviks during the Revolution; a Gaul and a centurion traded stories and laughed. Then a Macedonian spoke, and began to relate to us older stories. I heard things said: of Alexander and the Diadochi, of Mycenae and Abydos, of battles older than any empire remembered by name.

Their face is unburdened and unmarked by the experience of battle; they are not clothed in the fatigues of a fighting man. They smiled at me, sadly, and invited me to walk with them. When I refused, their smile became sadder still. I determined that whoever this was was terribly weak, and I watched them depart from my dream. Only when they were gone did I suddenly feel like I had lost something, and could not recover it.#mem.fear|I dreamt that I was a child again. I was looking through a keyhole into a room where someone I loved was suffering. Someone was beating them. Or perhaps they were writhing on the bed, groaning as some wasting disease chewed their nerves and burned their insides - that was something no strength could defeat on the field. I cannot remember the moment clearly, and perhaps that is good. I do not recall fondly the moments when I was helpless. Will something on the field render me helpless again?#mem.rage|I saw the hooked cross in my dream, taunting me. I went forth to tear at it and cast it down, but a shape that seemed like a man got in my way. This shape I beat savagely, and I derived no small amount of joy from the doing. This interloper disposed of, I went again towards the hooked cross, but more shapes met me on the path to stop me. A white-hot flame went up within me. I began to fight with my fists as they held me back, then with my teeth. I thrashed and bit at those faceless things that they might release me, bleeding and cracking from the exertion of it, but I never reached the hooked cross. I woke bitter.#mem.joy|I am running down a grassy hill. The wind is warm and the shade is there should I need it, and my favorite toy is in my hand, a close comrade. The calling of my mother is in the blue distance behind me. I should not yet go home, I think. So I take another hill, and another, and the day does not end. When I am tired at last, I bother my toy for some suggestion in the mad way children might. Only now, looking at him in my dream, do I remember what that toy was: a wooden soldier.#mem.calm|Small bells ring from somewhere unseen. I drift in a small boat on a placid sea, the surface of which is like silvered glass so that each star in the sky has a twin in the water. I lay on the floor of my boat so as to get a better look at the stars. I do not see them often in waking, but here they are, in my dream. I count them until sunrise wakes me, and I am in my tent, and the stars are gone.#mem.ingenuity|I have passed into the House tonight, I think. I walk over a snowfield where shades drift, listless, ebbing in and out of sight like vapours on the wind. Then high above me, a cloud of mercury parts just so, and I see behind it the furious orange-gold light of the place called Malleary. The ghosts who share the field with me look up in terror, or perhaps wonder, as the brilliance of the distant Malleary colours my dream. The White Door is very far from that place, but when I woke I could still hear the distant hammers and the humming of the Forge, joyfully at work.#mem.taste|In my dream, I made my way to the Well in the Wood, which bubbled and foamed with a contaminated sweetness. Watching the ebbing and flowing of the desire-fluid made me thirsty, and so I drank unwisely from the Well. Then came to me the shapes and scents of things I desired and had become starved of: meat and liquor and the skin of jilted lovers. Oh, these things were such an exquisite ache. I reached out to touch them, to taste, but these things receded back into the Well and I was again thirsty. And when I woke, I was thirsty still.#mem.grief|A crowd of grey faces finds me in the dream. I recognize these faces. Some wear the colours of the enemy; some do not. Some of them are old, and others so young I cannot bear to look upon them. I bury myself behind my hands - I cannot be responsible for <i>all</i> their deaths. I cannot.#mem.unexpected|I am in the bleached dark of the Wood, which sprawls across the dream-space beyond the House. My instincts swell in me like the budding of some unwholesome fruit, and I press to all fours to go nosing about the roots of the place. There is a bed of paper flowers that have no name in the waking world, scented with cinnamon and sandalwood and petrichor. There is a gold coin with a blank side, dropped here by one fleeing. And here is a porcelain teacup, and turning it over I find that within it is the sun. I understand.#mem.revelation|In the colourless pale of my dream, I saw a great golden brilliance flickering in the distance. I did so want to reach it. So with my wings I began the ascent, buzzing like some bee or imago emergent. As I neared the light, I could feel the scales falling away from me in sheets, like rain or ash. The mouth I did not have became very dry. Soon my dream was only that light, and in that light I could no longer feel myself distinct. Then I woke, and I found I did not have wings nor scales. But when I close my eyes, I can still see: Glory.@",
