A great groan of wood and stone - the gates of the city are opening. They have let him in. He is here, and the Sun is behind him. He is here, and though he cannot see, I cannot evade him. And his face - the tattered visage of his <i>face -</i>#draw.colonel.2|An uneven echoing rings through the Museum's silence, like a giant limping across the stones. Dread fills me. I hide myself in a hall where more Nevers and Nothings have been hung for display. Still the echoing comes. When he steps into the hall, I see him at last, and he is all sharp shapes and winter-white excruciation. The length of the room shortens then, and I am brought before him out in the open, weak and naked. My dream ends before I can suffer any mortal harm, but the chill of the Colonel's hand on my shoulder still aches, and aches horribly.@",
