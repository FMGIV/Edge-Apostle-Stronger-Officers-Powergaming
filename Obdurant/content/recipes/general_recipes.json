	"startdescription": "@#friend.daria.local|Daria is napping beneath a pine tree with a knife in her hand. 'Find your own shade,' she calls out as I approach. 'This tree's mine.' When she hears me approaching still, she spares me an annoyed glare; the glare changes to intrigue when she sees it is me. 'Oh. The others have been talking about you. <i>Capitan.</i> I've actually wanted to speak with you, you know...'#friend.padre.local|The priest is at the graves: grim rows of wrapped bodies, each corpse with a crucifix posted by its head. 'Twice in a forty years Europe has gone to war. <i>Mannaggia</i> - such a waste of youth, to send boys to die.' He straightens one of the crosses and looks at me. 'Sometimes war is necessary. But this never is.'#friend.fiorenza.local|A sprinting Fiorenza crashes into me, tumbling down as if she'd hit a brick wall. I'm impressed when she springs again to her feet, apparently unfazed. 'You - I need your help,' she pants, slinging her rifle back over her shoulder. 'If you care anything about innocent lives, you'll listen to me.'#friend.lorenzo.local|Lorenzo is washing his instruments when I find him: surgeon's tools on his right; pots and pans on his left. 'Ah! Your arrival is most welcome,' he says when he notices me. 'Our little cell of fighters would be grateful for any help a seasoned partisan captain like yourself could offer. And we <i>do</i> have a... problem.'#friend.orsolina|'War, again. It has been a long time since I went to war,' Orsolina says. 'But I suppose even a housecat can remember something of being a lion. <i>Molto viene preso, ma molto rimane.</i> He made my kind to last, even when we don't.'#friend.giorgiou|Giorgiou tells me he has been working with a group of disgruntled <i>mafiosi</i>, who have been run thin by Mussolini's crackdowns. Their new business enterprise involves moving things for the resistance: supplies, weapons, artefacts. People, sometimes. 'But a burglar has been at our latest stock of exports,' he explains. 'This, I could use your help with.'#friend.zulfiya|Zulfiya eluded a few of our patrols earlier today. Now, by night, she appears directly before me, and I decide to humour her. My friend told me she can be a good ally to have. It's not much of a conversation, though. 'Voronezh. Black city. It was always dark here, before. Would you like to see? It's very beautiful, I promise.' I hope she's getting at something, and not only babbling.#friend.chaima|Lalla Chaima, the Huntress, receives me with silent respect. When she learns I am a friend of the one called Exile, she finally starts entertaining a conversation with me. 'So that's what they've put you up to? You seem a bit short of being Named,' Chaima says flatly. 'But if they thought you were capable of it, perhaps I am wrong.'#friend.yuri.local|Last I saw Yuri, he was a bright-eyed cadet who read too much Marx. The years have not diminished his fanaticism for Party ideology. 'A pleasure to see you again,' he says, saluting. 'The dialectic moves all things, doesn't it?' He always did talk that way. Figuratives.#friend.iosef.local|Iosef I knew from my youth. Seeing him now - I an officer, and he a convict pressed into service - I cannot say I was <i>wholly</i> unmoved. When we speak, his voice is a conspiratorial whisper: 'You've not forgotten your old friend, I hope. He's in great need of a favour.'#friend.konstantin.local|I have heard the doctor's name before, during the Terror. A 'physician' for the NKVD - I knew the NKVD, and they have no need for physicians. Dr. Ismailov, then, is more of a torturer than a surgeon. But perhaps I can find utility in that.#friend.nikolai.local|I have seen, here and there, Nikolai burn offerings to the Forge before operating his mortar. Today, I find him alone in the armoury, puzzling over a case of melted, misshapen rifles. He registers my presence with a grunt, then goes back to his examinations.@",
	"description": "@#friend.daria.local|'Back in the day, I was wanted. And I don't mean in the nice way.' Daria has been in many places doing many things. Lots of them illegal. She tosses her knife from one hand to the other as she speaks: 'Luckily, a war is a nice smokescreen for things. Records get lost, criminal archives go up in flames... I want to expedite the loss of knowledge a little. Knowledge about me, specifically.'#friend.padre.local|The priest and I speak of our experiences during the Great War. Quietly, he begins to regard me with a kind of respect. 'I do not know if you keep the faith, but everyone deserves peace and passage once they depart from this world,' he says. 'War makes it hard for the dead to acquire either of these. Walk with me. I will show you what I mean.'#friend.fiorenza.local|Fiorenza pulls me over to a map of the city. She points: 'Cathedral Square. Families. Elderly. Friends from the orchestra. Trapped.' Her voice is taut with stress. 'Please - they will die if nobody comes.' And then the pain in her eyes resolves to steel, and the timbre of her voice steadies with determination. 'Help me save them.'#friend.lorenzo.local|'You've seen our numbers. Many of us are not soldiers, and I only have so much to work with here,' Lorenzo gestures to the barren stock of the field tent. 'The hospital has rooms and medicine we can salvage. But men we send to reclaim that building do not return.' He leans low, and whsipers what he says next. 'The more supertitious of us say that, beneath the building, is something foul. <i>Un mostro.</i>'#friend.orsolina|Orsolina explains her recent efforts here in Campobasso, liberating the city and its outskirts day-by-day. 'I was not born an Italian, but I suppose I have chosen to be one. And because I have, I would like to see my chosen country free.' She takes out a map - sewer tunnels? A route is traced in black ink. 'I have been digging this route beneath the fort for some time, now. <i>Guarda qui...</i>'#friend.giorgiou|A man who had seen the 'burglar' says he thought it was a man in a feathered cloak - then it took flight. 'Thieves taking from thieves,' Giorgiou sighs. 'And greed is at the heart of war, you know. Why, our mutual friend once stole an entire fortune all by himself...' He then begins to talk about the historical relationship between conquest and plunder, but fortunately at this point the gunfire resumes.#friend.zulfiya|Zulfiya insists that I go visit this 'night-place of blackest oak' at once. I tell her that there are no more forests around Voronezh, and she insists I try harder to see them. I tell her I don't understand what she means, and she insists that I let her ink on my skin so I may, at last, understand.#friend.chaima|'I am here on business. The weather here is very disappointing, but the Russians are paying me well to hunt here, and I like challenges.' She polishes the barrel of her rifle. 'Do you like challenges?'#friend.yuri.local|'It is my responsibility to ensure our comrades serve in accordance with the Founder's doctrines. Sniff out weakness. Ideological treason,' Yuri says. He then steps closer. 'So, this matter in which I am about to ask your assistance is a great shame for me. Reprimand me as you see fit - but remember that even the watchful man must sometimes blink.'#friend.iosef.local|'I don't belong with these degenerates, <i>tovarisch.</i> Every march of ours is a death march,' Iosef says. 'But I think you can get me out. You're a ranking man - our commanding officer will listen to you. If you get him a certain something. You'll do it, yes? For your old friend?'#friend.konstantin.local|Dr. Ismailov shakes my hand. 'I've heard of you as well. Formerly of the OPRP, yes? I used to think you were all lunatics, but I've been convinced otherwise in recent years,' he smiles. 'If your contingent needs a doctor, I would be most interested in working together. You will need to help me with a professional matter first, though. A matter of science.'#friend.nikolai.local|Nikolai explains to me - in as few words as possible - how the armoury has been victim to peculiar instances of vandalism. The armoury is like a church to him, I think. For someone - or something - to be profaning his church is impermissible. He and I strike a mutual bargain amongst the shells and rifle-racks: I will help him, and he will help me.@",
