Men only following orders.#foe.watchdog|<i>Deutscher Schäferhund.</i> These beasts became fashionable in the Reich for how closely they resembled wolves, and they were fashionable at Sobibor, too, for how quickly they could rip a man apart for an officer's amusement.#foe.searchlight|They say mercy is only found in shadow. This glare from above let me understand that truth firsthand.#foe.starvation|Now and then, in my hunger, I would dream of the Red Cup, and I would listen to it laugh at me.#foe.cold|Sometimes, it got so cold there that the mind would fool itself into thinking it was warm outside. But we all knew there was only one season at Sobibor, and it was Winter.#foe.grame|If wolf-splinters are the soul's despair outpacing its light, and wrakes the agonies that consume the spirit, then wolf-grames are the simmering, festering rage of the unavenged and unanswered. I must be host to dozens.#foe.shade|'Are you not tired? Come, come. Walk with us on the road that knows no sun nor moon; no pain nor grief; no here nor there. Come, and there will be no more.'#hindrance.exilevoice|Rich like wine and cold as winter and as dead as bone. Laughter so cruel it could slip between the ribs like a knife-blade and twist in the guts. No sound fills me with more dread.#hindrance.exiletouch|Beatings, burnings; the pulling of nails and the peeling of skin. And there were things worse still the Exile would inflict on my body, and inflict with ecstasy.#hindrance.exiledesign|Night after night they would wax poetic of what they intended for me. All the pains inflicted and secrets whispered would hone me into something awful. I fear that - becoming the Exile’s perfect, awful instrument. But should I?#aggro.bombers|It is rare, these days, to see a Russian craft in the sky - the <i>Luftwaffe</i> clipped the Union's wings so early on in the war - but here and there remain a few red birds that still fly.#aggro.artillery|For when the Red Army must absolutely, positively obliterate a target. Don't stand in the firing zone.#aggro.tanks|The Union produces these machines at a furious pace. A few more months of hard service might finally retire these ones, but their replacements are no doubt already rolling to the front.#aggro.godbuilder|A cadre of commissars-ithast - 'god-builders' - leads this infantry detachment, stoking glorious fires in the weapons and flesh of their men.#aggro.infantry|The Soviet infantryman: cold-bitten, under-equipped, bound for death. He is a droplet in a wave that will smash the Eastern Front and drown the cities of the Reich.#aggro.sniper|A Russian sharpshooter waiting in the wings, coolly anticipating his next target.#aggro.scouts|Lookouts; pathfinders; forward troops for the Russian Army, guiding the Soviet counter-advance to Berlin.#foe.wrake|Some agonies are so intense that they can outlive the body that suffered them - and without a vessel, this wandering excruciation will hasten to find a new home. You don't want it to be you.#foe.cross|The Carapace Cross fled the world when we took it from them. Why have they come back?#hindrance.colonel|The Colonel's unseeing eyes scour the battlefield today. This power is only the lingering chill of his animosity, but it is enough to freeze screams in the throat and silence even the boldest man with dread.#foe.skaptodon|Burrowing giants, armed with claws and fangs that part stone like water. When one comes above ground, it is usually to part something else, like men, or tanks, or anything else that might be unlucky enough to come across a skaptodon in battle.#foe.echidniform.airborne|Temptation is a great enemy of honour. Those of the Lionsmith's warriors who submit to the seductions of the Ligeian Echidna lose their honour, but also undergo a great change. In them grow new innovations, new strengths, and most of all, new hungers.#foe.echidniform.grounded|Temptation is a great enemy of honour. Those of the Lionsmith's warriors who submit to the seductions of the Ligeian Echidna lose their honour, but also undergo a great change. In them grow new innovations, new strengths, and most of all, new hungers.#foe.hesukhine|Unusually patient, quiet, and perhaps even 'shy,' hesukhines are the most subtle of the Lionsmith's children. On the hunt, a hesukhine's operating standard is to go unseen - specifically, to go unseen until it is too late.#foe.spathiurus|These have been colloquially referred to as 'fencing lions' by teratologists. Don't try to fence with one, though - the blade-like appendage at the end of its tail can pierce and cut through almost any substance: steel, stone, flesh. Especially flesh.#foe.malkin|The cat and the owl are both holy to the Horned Axe. When the cat attains the wisdom of the owl - when its fur turns grey and its claws grow long and its life longer still - it is said to become one of these. It is only barely in our world, and as such we cannot touch it. But it can most certainly touch us.#foe.warder|High-ranking officers of the Légion du Seuil; keepers of the borders between this world and the Mansus. All of them claim Vak as their birth-tongue; all of them know what words forbid or permit passage.#foe.boundsmen|The quasi-human soldiers of the Légion du Seuil. They have been trained to move upright and speak in the tongues of men, but one cannot wholly suppress the original nature of a thing. Sometimes they will forget to blink. Sometimes they will eat the corpses of the dead.#foe.phlogisticant|Free from its cage of glass and steel, this wicked flame greedily devours all that it touches. The fierceness with which it burns isn't sustainable - but I don't think it much cares.#foe.engine|It looks like some kind of artillery fixture, though parts of its construction seem too complicated for its own good: cylinders of glass, coils of steel, tubes trembling with fire. But what firepower! Where this machine hits the mark, earth becomes glass and flesh becomes light. The King's toys are impressive, if nothing else.#foe.riflemen|Servants of the King on the Isle. Nothing exceptional, other than the fact they seemed to be trained a hair better than your average soldier.#foe.chasseur|Most soldiers give up the fight when they're killed. These ones don't.#hindrance.snows|Frost prohibits the way. Machines may fail, and men may freeze to death.#hindrance.storms|Thunder stalks the lightning through the clouds. Rain pounds like artillery-fire.#hindrance.fog|Sight and mobility are limited. It would be easy to walk into an ambush, or for a nasty fall to go misjudged.#hindrance.forest|Legions of trees stand upright and unmoving in the gloom. No easy road presents itself.#hindrance.fortifications|Minefields, caltrops, steel baricades. We will need to dismantle these defenses, or find a viable path through them.#hindrance.crags|Crags and shell-craters scar the land. Perception and caution will allow us to pass safely; fire and ingenuity will allow us to clear a path through these ruins.#hindrance.earthquake|The earth lies not dead, but sleeping.#hindrance.nocturnal|A shadow on the spirit, a disease of the soul, a knot of petrifying darkness.#hindrance.apollonian|This is the sort of light that scours the soul. Come and see, come and see -#hindrance.dionysian|The wilding-waste, the green-sickness that grows in the forest beneath the world - the Wood! The Wood! The Wood!#hindrance.lionsmith|The Lionsmith's proud brow scrutinizes the battlefield today. This power is only a passing ember of his animosity, but it is enough to ignite fires in the flesh and drive even the bravest man from the field.#hindrance.wolf|The Wolf-Divided walked here. His hatred lingers in the world, much like how the stench of a carcass lingers long after it has been dragged away. Even this mere echo of his enmity is a force that can unmake a man.#hindrance.worms|Here the world's skin is rotted to nothing. Things have crawled in through the wound.#hindrance.unknownlocation|Our goal is somewhere around here, but 'here' is a very broad word. Narrow the search.#hindrance.door|A heavy steel door bars the way. It is almost comforting how normal that is.#hindrance.wreckage|The way forward is blocked by collapsed masonry and rubble. We could blow the path clear with the proper tools, or painstakingly set about clearing what we can by hand.#hindrance.secretdoor|There is no point of ingress visible here, but that does not mean there isn't one here. Teasing it out will call for keen eyes.#hindrance.moonspace|Under the strange moon, up is sometimes down, and forward doesn't always lead ahead. The Meniscate's making trouble for us.#hindrance.greatseal|A dizzying knot of immutable magics prevents entry. We will need a great power of both unseaming and purification to clear the way.#foe.infantry|Man, the weapon.#foe.kommando|Formidable skirmishers and ambush tacticians, trained in tactics that emphasize aggression and manoeuvrability behind enemy lines.#foe.sniper|A skilled marksman, positioned advantageously, can hold back a hundred men. Someone silent or sneaky might be able to close in on him undetected.#foe.tanks|A German tank is a fearsome machine. Facing it head-on would require a serious amount of direct firepower, but specialized munitions may allow us to circumvent an otherwise brutal fight.#foe.bombers|First there is the thrum of the rotors, then the long whistle of the descent, and then the scream of new fire.#foe.artillery|A heavy gun emplacement watched by German engineers and enemy patrols. A brute force assault might work - we could storm the position, destroy the guns. Or a saboteur might leave the engineers a very loud, very forceful surprise.#foe.manhunters|An infantry detachment led by initiates of the fatal arts. Force alone will not suffice here - we must equal whatever adeptry they bring to field with some of our own.#foe.undead|Not all the dead see the end of war. We can banish them with force and weaponry, but the secrets of Winter might offer a way to lay them to rest.#foe.warrior|The Lionsmith's monsters are bound by certain honours. If one disgraces itself by consuming that which they have not slain themselves, he will revoke their strength and intellect. This monster had gotten greedy, and the pains of its degeneration have rendered it half-mad, but even in its death throes it will prove a nasty foe.#foe.serpent|A monstrous serpent, come to glut itself on the battlefield dead.

Men only following orders.#foe.watchdog|<i>Deutscher Schäferhund.</i> These beasts became fashionable in the Reich for how closely they resembled wolves, and they were fashionable at Sobibor, too, for how quickly they could rip a man apart for an officer's amusement.#foe.searchlight|They say mercy is only found in shadow. This glare from above let me understand that truth firsthand.#foe.starvation|Now and then, in my hunger, I would dream of the Red Cup, and I would listen to it laugh at me.#foe.cold|Sometimes, it got so cold there that the mind would fool itself into thinking it was warm outside. But we all knew there was only one season at Sobibor, and it was Winter.#foe.grame|If wolf-splinters are the soul's despair outpacing its light, and wrakes the agonies that consume the spirit, then wolf-grames are the simmering, festering rage of the unavenged and unanswered. I must be host to dozens.#foe.shade|'Are you not tired? Come, come. Walk with us on the road that knows no sun nor moon; no pain nor grief; no here nor there. Come, and there will be no more.'#hindrance.exilevoice|Rich like wine and cold as winter and as dead as bone. Laughter so cruel it could slip between the ribs like a knife-blade and twist in the guts. No sound fills me with more dread.#hindrance.exiletouch|Beatings, burnings; the pulling of nails and the peeling of skin. And there were things worse still the Exile would inflict on my body, and inflict with ecstasy.#hindrance.exiledesign|Night after night they would wax poetic of what they intended for me. All the pains inflicted and secrets whispered would hone me into something awful. I fear that - becoming the Exile’s perfect, awful instrument. But should I?#aggro.bombers|It is rare, these days, to see a Russian craft in the sky - the <i>Luftwaffe</i> clipped the Union's wings so early on in the war - but here and there remain a few red birds that still fly.#aggro.artillery|For when the Red Army must absolutely, positively obliterate a target. Don't stand in the firing zone.#aggro.tanks|The Union produces these machines at a furious pace. A few more months of hard service might finally retire these ones, but their replacements are no doubt already rolling to the front.#aggro.godbuilder|A cadre of commissars-ithast - 'god-builders' - leads this infantry detachment, stoking glorious fires in the weapons and flesh of their men.#aggro.infantry|The Soviet infantryman: cold-bitten, under-equipped, bound for death. He is a droplet in a wave that will smash the Eastern Front and drown the cities of the Reich.#aggro.sniper|A Russian sharpshooter waiting in the wings, coolly anticipating his next target.#aggro.scouts|Lookouts; pathfinders; forward troops for the Russian Army, guiding the Soviet counter-advance to Berlin.#foe.wrake|Some agonies are so intense that they can outlive the body that suffered them - and without a vessel, this wandering excruciation will hasten to find a new home. You don't want it to be you.#foe.cross|The Carapace Cross fled the world when we took it from them. Why have they come back?#hindrance.robigo|<i>Who's there? Lacombe? Lee? Please, help me. It's getting harder to breathe... it's so dark. Dark.</i>#hindrance.colonel|The Colonel's unseeing eyes scour the battlefield today. This power is only the lingering chill of his animosity, but it is enough to freeze screams in the throat and silence even the boldest man with dread.#foe.skaptodon|Burrowing giants, armed with claws and fangs that part stone like water. When one comes above ground, it is usually to part something else, like men, or tanks, or anything else that might be unlucky enough to come across a skaptodon in battle.#foe.echidniform.airborne|Temptation is a great enemy of honour. Those of the Lionsmith's warriors who submit to the seductions of the Ligeian Echidna lose their honour, but also undergo a great change. In them grow new innovations, new strengths, and most of all, new hungers.#foe.echidniform.grounded|Temptation is a great enemy of honour. Those of the Lionsmith's warriors who submit to the seductions of the Ligeian Echidna lose their honour, but also undergo a great change. In them grow new innovations, new strengths, and most of all, new hungers.#foe.hesukhine|Unusually patient, quiet, and perhaps even 'shy,' hesukhines are the most subtle of the Lionsmith's children. On the hunt, a hesukhine's operating standard is to go unseen - specifically, to go unseen until it is too late.#foe.spathiurus|These have been colloquially referred to as 'fencing lions' by teratologists. Don't try to fence with one, though - the blade-like appendage at the end of its tail can pierce and cut through almost any substance: steel, stone, flesh. Especially flesh.#foe.malkin|The cat and the owl are both holy to the Horned Axe. When the cat attains the wisdom of the owl - when its fur turns grey and its claws grow long and its life longer still - it is said to become one of these. It is only barely in our world, and as such we cannot touch it. But it can most certainly touch us.#foe.warder|High-ranking officers of the Légion du Seuil; keepers of the borders between this world and the Mansus. All of them claim Vak as their birth-tongue; all of them know what words forbid or permit passage.#foe.boundsmen|The quasi-human soldiers of the Légion du Seuil. They have been trained to move upright and speak in the tongues of men, but one cannot wholly suppress the original nature of a thing. Sometimes they will forget to blink. Sometimes they will eat the corpses of the dead.#foe.phlogisticant|Free from its cage of glass and steel, this wicked flame greedily devours all that it touches. The fierceness with which it burns isn't sustainable - but I don't think it much cares.#foe.engine|It looks like some kind of artillery fixture, though parts of its construction seem too complicated for its own good: cylinders of glass, coils of steel, tubes trembling with fire. But what firepower! Where this machine hits the mark, earth becomes glass and flesh becomes light. The King's toys are impressive, if nothing else.#foe.riflemen|Servants of the King on the Isle. Nothing exceptional, other than the fact they seemed to be trained a hair better than your average soldier.#foe.chasseur|Most soldiers give up the fight when they're killed. These ones don't.#hindrance.snows|Frost prohibits the way. Machines may fail, and men may freeze to death.#hindrance.storms|Thunder stalks the lightning through the clouds. Rain pounds like artillery-fire.#hindrance.fog|Sight and mobility are limited. It would be easy to walk into an ambush, or for a nasty fall to go misjudged.#hindrance.forest|Legions of trees stand upright and unmoving in the gloom. No easy road presents itself.#hindrance.fortifications|Minefields, caltrops, steel baricades. We will need to dismantle these defenses, or find a viable path through them.#hindrance.crags|Crags and shell-craters scar the land. Perception and caution will allow us to pass safely; fire and ingenuity will allow us to clear a path through these ruins.#hindrance.earthquake|The earth lies not dead, but sleeping.#hindrance.nocturnal|A shadow on the spirit, a disease of the soul, a knot of petrifying darkness.#hindrance.apollonian|This is the sort of light that scours the soul. Come and see, come and see -#hindrance.dionysian|The wilding-waste, the green-sickness that grows in the forest beneath the world - the Wood! The Wood! The Wood!#hindrance.lionsmith|The Lionsmith's proud brow scrutinizes the battlefield today. This power is only a passing ember of his animosity, but it is enough to ignite fires in the flesh and drive even the bravest man from the field.#hindrance.wolf|The Wolf-Divided walked here. His hatred lingers in the world, much like how the stench of a carcass lingers long after it has been dragged away. Even this mere echo of his enmity is a force that can unmake a man.#hindrance.worms|Here the world's skin is rotted to nothing. Things have crawled in through the wound.#hindrance.unknownlocation|Our goal is somewhere around here, but 'here' is a very broad word. Narrow the search.#hindrance.door|A heavy steel door bars the way. It is almost comforting how normal that is.#hindrance.wreckage|The way forward is blocked by collapsed masonry and rubble. We could blow the path clear with the proper tools, or painstakingly set about clearing what we can by hand.#hindrance.secretdoor|There is no point of entry visible here, but that does not mean one does not exist. Teasing it out will call for keen eyes.#hindrance.moonspace|Under the strange moon, up is sometimes down, and forward doesn't always lead ahead. The Meniscate's making trouble for us.#hindrance.greatseal|A dizzying knot of immutable magics prevents entry. We will need a great power of both unseaming and purification to clear the way.#foe.infantry|Man, the weapon.#foe.kommando|Formidable skirmishers and ambush tacticians, trained in tactics that emphasize aggression and manoeuvrability behind enemy lines.#foe.sniper|A skilled marksman, positioned advantageously, can hold back a hundred men. Someone silent or sneaky might be able to close in on him undetected.#foe.tanks|A German tank is a fearsome machine. Facing it head-on would require a serious amount of direct firepower, but specialized munitions may allow us to circumvent an otherwise brutal fight.#foe.bombers|First there is the thrum of the rotors, then the long whistle of the descent, and then the scream of new fire.#foe.artillery|A heavy gun emplacement watched by German engineers and enemy patrols. A brute force assault might work - we could storm the position, destroy the guns. Or a saboteur might leave the engineers a very loud, very forceful surprise.#foe.manhunters|An infantry detachment led by initiates of the fatal arts. Force alone will not suffice here - we must equal whatever adeptry they bring to field with some of our own.#foe.undead|Not all the dead see the end of war. We can banish them with force and weaponry, but the secrets of Winter might offer a way to lay them to rest.#foe.warrior|The Lionsmith's monsters are bound by certain honours. If one disgraces itself by consuming that which they have not slain themselves, he will revoke their strength and intellect. This monster had gotten greedy, and the pains of its degeneration have rendered it half-mad, but even in its death throes it will prove a nasty foe.#foe.serpent|A monstrous serpent, come to glut itself on the battlefield dead. Its crushing strength and dreadful venoms might be overcome in battle, but Knock might offer us a way to placate it.#foe.growth|Corpses touched by a power from Nowhere, set again in the world as a walking, budding disease. Scour it with fire, or with light.#foe.labhite.grounded|The youngest of the Lionsmith's children, and the most beautiful. Labhites are especially fierce on the wing, but one on the ground is no easy foe, either. Its strength is monstrous, and its body glows with candescent heat.#foe.labhite.airborne|The youngest of the Lionsmith's children, and the most beautiful. Labhites are especially fierce on the wing, armed with burning-breath and razor-talons to decimate those unfortunate enough to have drawn their wrath.#foe.splinter|A prowling shard of lean grey malice. No weapons we wield can harm it, but we can send it whimpering back to the Wood with enough light or constancy.#foe.niniame|Protectress-beast of the Unseen Lake and elder sister of the sword-keeper, who bore her away at great cost when the Serpent-Mother demanded her death. She did not always have fangs; she did not always have scales and talons - but she still holds dear her younger sister.#foe.ostlingant|Minor servants of the Aviform Hours, known as secret-carriers and minstrel-deceivers. They do not fly by daylight - nor anywhere in the waking world, for that matter - and their songs are not meant for mortal ears.#foe.voice|'Turn back, turn back...'#hindrance.star.a|A furious fire from heaven, thrown down to earth by the stroke of the Lionsmith's hammer. Angry would be an understatement.#hindrance.star.b|The star is dying, now; its light flickers red. But still, I must do one more thing: I must take its heart in my hand, rip it free, and devour it. Trying to do this might turn me to ash. Still, I will try.@",
