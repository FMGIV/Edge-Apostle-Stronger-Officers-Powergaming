In time, however, the boy came to be the ward of a host of monks, and was raised by hymnal and fasting and prayer. But in his heart, the boy only ever prayed for one thing. He never got it - and three hundred years later, when Red fought White on the slopes of Old Rus, the Iron-Eater sent the Orphan to join the rest of his family.",
